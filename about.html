                        <p class="about-txt">I'm an artist with a rich background in IT and design. My artistic journey is driven by a lifelong passion for creativity and a desire to explore. My portfolio showcases a diverse array of artwork, primarily in oil paint, acrylic paint, digital, and pencil. You'll find pieces featuring animals, landscape scenery, and even some fantasy themes are currently in the works. I'm inspired by nature, wildlife, and sometimes just get carried away in my strange imagination.</p>
                        <p class="about-txt">I work from home, balancing my art with life as a mother of three wonderful (well, most of the time) children. My workspace is shared with my budgie, Dandelion, who keeps me company and often screams at me, as I create.</p>
                        <p class="about-txt">In 2021, I was honoured to be the winner of the Open University Design Exhibition. This achievement proved to me that I could move forward in the creative world and reignited my ambition and imagination, after years of just being 'Mummy'.</p>
                        <p class="about-txt">Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you enjoy exploring my work as much as I enjoy creating it. Feel free to contact me for any inquiries or collaboration ideas.</p>
                        <p class="about-txt">Warm regards,</p>
