                    <h3>What images do you need?</h3>
                    <p>High-quality, clear images showing your pet's unique features and expression. The lighting of the image is particularly significant if the comission is in colour. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does it take?</h3>
                    <p>Typically, 2-8 weeks depending on size, medium, and complexity. Please allow extra time during busy periods and consider whether you require the finished painting for a certain date. I will always try to accomodate where possible and I am open to discussing your requirements and whether I can meet them.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What will I recieve?</h3>
                    <p>A hand painted portrait of your pet is done on canvas panel as standard and framed if requested. I recommend canvas panel and framing for oil paintings due to curing time, this helps in preserving the painting and maintaining a dust free surface. Other materials can be discussed prior to starting your comissiona, these can vary from wood to stretched canvas depending on the medium requested.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What kind of background can I have?</h3>
                    <p>A single colour background would usually provide sole focus on your pet, however in theory any background is possible. If you would like an especially intricate background this would be charges as an extra subject (see pricelist).</p>
