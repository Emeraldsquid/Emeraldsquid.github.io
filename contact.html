                            <h3>What images do you need?</h3>
                            <p>High-quality, clear images showing your pet's unique features and expression. The lighting of the image is particularly significant if the commission is in color.</p>

                            <h3>How long does it take?</h3>
                            <p>Typically, 2-8 weeks depending on size, medium, and complexity. Please allow extra time during busy periods and consider whether you require the finished painting for a certain date. I will always try to accommodate where possible.</p>

                            <h3>What will I receive?</h3>
                            <p>A hand-painted portrait of your pet, done on canvas panel as standard and framed if requested. I recommend canvas panel and framing for oil paintings due to curing time. Other materials can be discussed prior to starting your commission.</p>

                            <h3>What kind of background can I have?</h3>
                            <p>A single colour background would usually provide sole focus on your pet, however in theory any background is possible. If you would like an especially intricate background this would be charges as an extra subject (see pricelist).</p>
